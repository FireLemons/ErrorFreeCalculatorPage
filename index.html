            <p>This reduced error calculator is a new take on the classic calculator. On a typical calculator a user is allowed to type "+++" and "tan()" and is able to send the erroneous expression for evalutaion. ErrorFreeCalculator was built to make entering some erroneous expressions impossible by disabling buttons when entering an expression.</p>
